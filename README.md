**Project Objectives:**
1. To utilize a machine learning algorithm on a dataset
2. In this case, I used logistic regression on the Titanic dataset to predict a passenger's survivability

<br>

**The Process:**
1. Read in data as DataFrame
2. Begin initial exploratory data analysis and visual variables against one another to discover patterns
3. Cleaning missing data
4. Handling categorical features by converting it into a dummy variable with pd.ge_dummies()
5. Train the model
6. Evaluate the model
